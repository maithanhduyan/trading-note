# Way of The Turtle

## One : Risk Junkies
*High risk, high reward: It takes balls of steel to play this game.*
**—Told to a friend before starting the Turtle program**

## Two : Taming the Turtle Mind
*Human emotion is both the source of opportunity in trading and the greatest challenge. Master it and you will succeed. 
Ignore it at your peril.*

## Three : The First $2 Million is th Toughest
*Trade with an edge, manage risk, be consistent, and keep it simple.
The entire Turtle training, and indeed the basis for all successfull training,
can be summed up in these four core principles.*

## Four : Think Like a Turtle 
*Good trading is not about being right, it is about trading right.
If you want to be successful, you need to think of the long run
and ignore the outcomes of individual trades.*
## Five : Trading with an Edge
*Trading with an edge is what separates the professionals
froms the amateurs. Ignore this and you will be eaten by those who don't.*

* ***Portfolio selection***: The algorithms that select which markets are valid for trading on any specific day*
* ***Entry signals***: The algorithms that determine when to buy or sell to enter a trades*
* ***Exit signals*** : The algorithms that determine when to buy or sell to exit a trade.*
		 
## Six : Falling Off the Edge
*Edges are found in the places that are the battlegrounds between buyers and sellers. 
Your task as a trader is to find those places and wait to see who wins and who loses.*
## Seven : By What Measure?
*Mature understanding of and respect for risk is the hallmark of the best traders. 
They know that if you don’t keep an eye on risk, it will set its eye on you.*

* ***Drawdowns***: *Strings of losses that reduce the capital in their
trading accounts*
* ***Low returns***: *Periods of small gains in which one does not
make enough money to live on*
* ***Price shocks***: *Sudden movements in one or more markets
that result in a large unrecoverable loss*
* ***System death***: *A change in market dynamics that causes a
previously profitable system to start losing money*
## Eight : Risk and Money Management
*Ruin is the risk you should be concerned with the most.
It can come like a thief in the night and steal everything
if you aren’t watching carefully.*
    Here is what I believe accounts for a trader’s lack of success in
trading commodities:
* ***No plan***: *Many traders base their trades on hunches, rumor,
guesses, and the belief that they know something about the
future direction of prices.*
* ***Too much risk***: *Many otherwise excellent traders have been
ruined because they incurred too much risk. I’m not talking
about 50 percent or 100 percent more risk than is prudent. I
have seen traders who trade at a level that is 5 or 10 times
more than I consider prudent even for aggressive trading.*
* ***Unrealistic expectations***: *Many new traders trade with too
much risk because they have unrealistic expectations about
how much they can earn and what sorts of returns they can
achieve. This is often also the reason new traders believe
they can start trading on the basis of fundamental data; they
believe they are smart enough to “beat” the market with
little or no training and very little information.*
## Nine : Turtle-Style Building Blocks
*Don’t spend all your time admiring the fancy tools
in the magazines. First learn how to use the basic ones well.
It’s not the size of your tools that counts but how well you use them.*

* ***Breakouts***: *These are situations when the price exceeds the
highest high or the lowest low for a specific number of days.
This was the primary tool used in the original Turtle system.*
* ***Moving averages***: *These are continuously calculated
averages of the price for a specific number of days. They are
called moving averages because they are calculated each
day and their value therefore moves up and down with the
new prices.*
* ***Volatility channels***: *These are built by adding a specific
amount of price to a moving average that is based on a
measure of market volatility such as the standard deviation
or ATR.*
* ***Time-based exits***: *These are the simplest possible exits: You
exit the market at a specific, predetermined time (e.g., exit
the market after 10 days or after 80 days).*
* ***Simple lookbacks***: *These involve a comparison of the
current price with a historical price at some earlier period.*
## Ten : Turtle-Style Trading: Step by Step
*Keep it simple. Simple time-tested methods that are
well executed will beat fancy complicated methods every time.*

* ***ATR Channel Breakout***: *A volatility channel system that
uses ATR as the volatility measure.*
* ***Bollinger Breakout***: *A volatility channel system that uses
the standard deviation as the volatility measure.*
* ***Donchian Trend***: *A breakout system with a trend filter.
* ***Donchian Trend with Time Exit***: A breakout system with a
trend filter and a time-based exit.*
* ***Dual Moving Average***: *A system that buys and sells when a
faster moving average crosses over a slower moving average.
Unlike the other systems, this system is always in the market,
either long or short.*
* ***Triple Moving Average***: *A system that buys and sells when a
faster moving average crosses over a slower moving average
but only in the direction of the major trend defined by a
very slow-moving average.*
## Eleven :Lies, Damn Lies, and Backtests
*Charlatans and scoundrels lurk in dark corners,
awaiting the unsuspecting. Don’t be their prey.*

* ***Trader effects***: *The fact that a particular method has made a
lot of money in the recent past increases the likelihood that
other traders will have noticed it and will start using similar
ideas, increasing the chances that the method will not work
as well as it did initially.*
* ***Random effects***: *The historical test may have demonstrated
better performance than the underlying edge normally
would indicate as a result of purely random chance.*
* ***Optimization paradox***: *The act of determining the
particular parameter, such as choosing a 25-day moving
average instead of a 30-day average, reduces the predictive
value of the backtest itself.*
* ***Overfitting or curve fitting***: *The system may be so
complicated that it has no predictive value. Because it is
tuned to the historical data so closely, a slight alteration in
market behavior will produce markedly poorer results.*
## Twelve : On Solid Ground
*Trading with poor methods is like learning to juggle while
standing in a rowboat during a storm. Sure, it can be done, but it is
much easier to juggle when one is standing on solid ground.*
## Thirteen : Bulletproof Systems
*Trading is not a sprint; it’s boxing. The market will beat you up,
screw with your head, and do anything it can to defeat you.
But when the bell sounds at the end of the twelfth round,
you must be standing in the ring in order to win.Trading is not a sprint; it’s boxing. The market will beat you up,

But when the bell sounds at the end of the twelfth round,

## Fourteen : Mastering Your Demons
*The market does not care how you feel. It will not prop up your ego or
console you when you are down. Therefore, trading is not for everyone.
If you are unwilling to face the truth about the markets and the truth
about your own limitations, fears, and failures, you will not succeed.*
